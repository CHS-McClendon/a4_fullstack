		<h4>What does "Full" in Full Stack mean?</h4>
		<pre>
	Full means that you develop both the front end, and the back end.
	The front end is what the user sees on what is called the client computer.
	The back end is what is on the server computer that delivers content to the front end.
		</pre>				
		
 <h4>What does "Stack" in Full Stack mean?</h4>
		<pre>
	Stack means that several programs, a "stack" of programs is used.
	On the front end I use HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.
	On the back end I use PHP, and MySQL.
	And I also have a LAMP stack on my server computer.
		</pre>		
		
		
 <h4>What does "<a href="images/LAMP-wip.png">LAMP</a> mean?</h4>
		<pre>
	LAMP is a stack used for our web page server - remember, a server sends web pages to a client.
	LAMP stands for:
	L = Linux, which is the basis of our server operating system
	A = Apache, which is our web server
	M = <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL">MySQL</a>, the database we use
	P = PHP, which is the programming language we use on the server side
		</pre>

		<h3> -- Start of Checkpoint 02 --</h3>

		<p>
			1. Explain DB: Organized way to save data on a server.  LIFEBLOOD of all business, to track
			employees, customers, products, services, suppliers ...

		</p>

		<p>

			2. Explain MySQL: Number 2 among the most-used DB's in the entire world!  Oracle is number 1
			because it offers professional support, but it is a paid service.  MySQL is FREE!  The inventor of MySQL
			named this after his first daughter, her name is "My."  This same inventor later
			created MariaDB, after his second daughter "Maria."

		</p>

		<p>

			3. Explain SQL:  Structured Query Language.  MySQL is the name of the database,
			while SQL is the language you use inside of that database to answer questions --
			like "which products are slow sellers, which products are fast sellers..."  SQL is
			an international standard language, works with MySQL, Oracle SQL, Microsoft SQL server,
			and many others.
		</p>

		<p>
			4. PHP is a programming language that connects front end to back end.  PHP reads HTML forms,
			then sends that form info to the server.  PHP also reads the DB, and sends that back to
			another HTML form.  PHP is a server-side language, totally secure and private -
			you can't see PHP when you do a "view source."

		</p>

		<p>
			5. MySQL table: Has rows and columns, where data is organized in cells
			(rows are horizontal, columns are vertical).  Looks like an Excel spreadsheet,
			but as you will learn it is actually very different from Excel.

		</p>

		<p>
			6. MySQL from the CLI (Command Line Interface) -- NTS, structure when done

			--The User Interface for DB's are HTML pages that WE create!
			-- The CLI is where experts, where the Power Users can see inside of the DB
			but in a very primitive, non-GUI way.  In other words, CLI is for the DB experts,
			not the users.
